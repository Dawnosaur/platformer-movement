# platformer-movement

Many other features found in platformers were excluded from this video due to time, difficulty, etc. Many of these will be added to the code above shortly, however, some may take a bit longer.
So here is a small collection of some other features you could consider adding.
- Changes to acceleration when in the air 
- Changes to acceleration when turning
- Dash
- Double Jumps
- Wall Jumps (was having trouble getting these to work without overriding velocity will release code whenever I get something that feels nice, working)

Hope this helps you out
