# platformer-movement

Everything from the video and now more!
Now Includes: Dashes, Wall Jumps, Slide and State Machine

## Guide to the Scripts

### Player Data

  A scriptable object that contains all the parameters for your player
  eg: maxRunSpeed, jumpForce etc
  
### Advanced Player (recommended)

  1) My recommened platformer script
  2) Has all the features shown in the video, with some bonus stuff
  3) Great if you're looking to upgrade your platformer script 

### State Machine Player
  1) The most complex and expandable platformer system
  2) A Finite State Machine is a great architecture if you're planning to work on your game for a long time and increase the complexity
  3) Allows full incredible flexibility
  4) Can require more time to implement and upkeep


### Basic Player (very broken lol)
  1) Ignore for now
  2) Will later be used to show contrast between player types
